The project Translation

The Translation project is an important project for Digidem Lab and as you say will open the Lab to 93,000 Arabic speaking people in Sweden and beyond. The website for Digidem Lab will be updated in the coming months so translation for the main website would be suitable to start in september. But before then, the Digidem Guide (very similar name so now it’s changing to ”Democrat”) which is an online guide about participatory tools, would benefit from existing in arabic right away. If you choose to continue I will give you the contacts to the Lab project leaders Sara and Jennie who are working with making it accessible through youthful language and the catbot.

To avoid work overload there are three project options:

* Translate Digidemguide/Democat to arabic
* Translate Democrats very own catboat to arabic! The catbot a chatrobot that anyone can chat with that answers questions about participatory tools in funny funny ways.
* Translate parts of the webpage starting september 2017

All these options would include documenting the process and spread the good news in social media.

Wishing you a splendid day!
