## Collective Intelligence :thermometer: :boom::heart_eyes:
We believe in sharing skills and experiences for better results. Digidem Open Lab is a collaborative space where activists, designers, developers and others get together to experiment and create the tools of change for the future. We meet every week in Gothenburg to create the shape of participation to come.

## The Lab :fire::seedling:
The Lab is a collaborative space for projects exploring participation with digital tools. If you are 18-25 years old and living in Sweden, you can apply to run your own project for three months. You will get paid for four hours a week, have access to the space and mentoring from our Lab Managers, and connect to our national and international network.
