## What is the aim of the project?
To raise awareness about the problems with locked down hardware and offer open alternatives.
We have regular meetups and have created a [wiki](https://wiki.inbyggd-frihet.org/), to support the opening of locked down systems.

## What do you hope to achieve?
We will keep adding more information to the wiki and take the discussion about freedom further.
