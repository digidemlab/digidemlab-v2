The purpose of the project is to spread information about the current security situation in Afghanistan and change the political debate and the decisions taken by authorities and politicians.
Sittsrejken is an organisation started by unaccompanied refugees from Afghanistan. We demand a stop of all deportations to Afghanistan and question the legally insecure asylum process of the Swedish Migration Agency. We also advocate an external inquiry into the work made by the Swedish Migration Agency.

It started as a sit-down strike the 11th of August 2018 that lasted for ten days. When the schools started the sit-down strike became a weekly manifestation to the Swedish Migration Agency, were we deliver our message with information about the current security situation in Afghanistan and urge them to stop all deportations. During our project we will create a newspaper that contains all these messages of information that we will hand out in Almedalen 2018.
