## What have you done so far?
The aim of my project is to find a platform where different social movements can share knowledge, within their own movement and with others. I couldn't find such a platform and started looking at how to create one. I have interviewed people from different movements to find out about their needs, and tried to find existing open source tools to adress those needs.
My conclusion was to create a structured online forum to exchange knowledge and experiences. The forum can be found here: <https://verkstan.org>

## How will you take the project further?
I will keep developing to forum and start a discussion in the forum itself about how to take it further. The main task now is to reach out to as many people as possible in movements and to start using the forum and filling it with content. I welcome all feedback about how to make the forum better and please invite everyone you know to start using it! :slightly_smiling_face:
