## What will you do?
Develop a pilot of an AR-application that combines development of knowledge and storytelling. The project commences by research and skills development, and continues with team recruitment and building a prototype.

## What results do you hope for?
A greater understanding for the AR-media and a prototype that presents the main functions of the concept.

##  Why do you want to work with this?
I have a great passion for exploring the XR-media (Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality / Mixed Reality) and I believe in its potential both as its own media but also as a complement to the traditional 2D-film.
