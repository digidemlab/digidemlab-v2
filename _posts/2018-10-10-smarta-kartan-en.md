## What will you do?
During this project, we will be working with Kollaborative Ekonomi Göteborg (KEG) and a team of developers to create a new and improved version of Smartakartan. We will be working as designers to redesign the interface to be mobile first, more user friendly, and more inspiring.

## What will the result be?
We hope that by the end of the project the new Smartakartan site will be launched featuring our designs. The Smartakartan 2.0 design will be a roadmap to open sourcing the Smartakartan website in the future for other cities to adopt. We also hope to publish a library of the design assets we create during the project and our learnings about designing for a citizen platform.
