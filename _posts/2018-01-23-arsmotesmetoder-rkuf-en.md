## What is the project about?
I work with RKUF (youth organisation for the Red Cross) and want to find new digital tools to make our annual meeting more accessible. At our evaluations, people have asked for a clearer process during the meetings and more opportunities to raise ideas.

## What is the aim of the project?
We want to create a better understanding for the democratic process in our organisation. First and foremost at the annual meeting, but also between the meetings. Clarity and transparency is very important, since we are a youth organisation where many of our members are new to these kind of processes.
