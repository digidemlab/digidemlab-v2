## What will you do?
I will work on a website for Multiversitetet, a new project where anyone can organise meet-ups to learn things together for example repairing things, playing the guitar, ceramics etc. The meet-ups should always be free, therefore we want a website where people can self organise.

## Purpose of the project
I hope that the website will make it easier for anyone to organise and participate in different meet-ups, so that as many as possible can take part in different spare time activities and meet a lot of new people.
