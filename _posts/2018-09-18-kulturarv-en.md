## What will you do?
I will conduct a pilot study of how citizen participation can help collect data about our mutual cultural heritage. This project is inspired by the British project "CITiZAN" and will be conducted with the help of free accessible data.

## Purpose of the project
Sweden's cultural environment law says: "The responsibility for the cultural environment is shared by all". Through this pilot study I hope to create the foundation of something that actually makes people contribute in being responsible for the cultural environment.
