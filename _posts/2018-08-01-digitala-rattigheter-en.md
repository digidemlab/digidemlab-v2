## What will you do?
Democratise and make digital rights accessible for young people. Also raise awareness among young people about data trails. I will work on creating workshops and opinion forming for young people and different actors together with Digidem Lab.

## Purpose of the project
There is a need for easier access of information about what happens to your own data. There is a need for a platform where young people easily can access it. How it affects you both in a normative way but also structurally.
