  text: I have a passion for justice with focus on the climate, environment and gender
    issues. I like learning new languages and work with translation in different contexts.
    Besides this project I study global studies and I'm active in the grass roots
    campaign Fossilgasf√§llan that is based in Gothenburg.

## What will you do?
I will work on translating the two citizen platforms Consul och Decidim. They are web-based tools to help increase citizen participation in city districts, cities and communities.

## Purpose of the project
By translating the platforms to several languages - German in my case - the platforms become accessible and usable for a lot more people.
