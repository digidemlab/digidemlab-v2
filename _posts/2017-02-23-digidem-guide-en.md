## Practical Introduction
Digidem Guide is a practical introduction to digital tools for participatory democracy.
The guide helps decision makers in NGO:s, political parties and local municipalities
find new tools for facilitating democratic processes.

## Growing Field
There is a growing field of digital tools to facilitate democratic processes on all levels of society. This guide does not try to be a comprehensive list of all initiatives and user cases, but a practical introduction to this field and the tools that we think best suit the different needs of practitioners.

## International team
The initial selection of tools was based on recommendations from the international community of ninety experts gathered at the Inteligencia Colectiva Para La Democracia 2016 at Medialab Prado in Madrid. The Digidem Guide working group chose 6 tools from that selection, which adds real value to democratic processes, are userfriendly, reliable and adaptable.

## Pilot version
The current guide is a pilot version. We welcome feedback and ideas to be able to develop the guide further.
