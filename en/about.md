People under 26 years old, living in Sweden, can [apply for funding](/en/apply) for their project.

## Citizen platforms
Digidem Lab cooperates with the City of Madrid and regions in Gothenburg and Stockholm to develop Consul, the world's most used citizen platform. The "[Demokratiska St√§der](http://demokratiskastader.se)" website is a collection of methods and tools for Swedish cities that want to take their citizen participation to the next level.

## Social movements
We provide workshops and lectures for social movements about new tools for organising, decision making and coordination of campaigns.

## Hackathons
In [CivicTechGbg](http://civictechgbg.se/en/) developers, designers, activists and open data enthusiasts come together to build applications, visualisations and tools for citizens.
