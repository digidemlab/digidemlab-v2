## Democracy lab
Digidem Lab brings together activists, researchers, programmers, designers and everyone who believes that another world is possible, to create the methods and tools for the participatory democracy of the future.

## Citizen platforms
Digidem Lab cooperates with the City of Madrid and regions in Gothenburg and Stockholm to develop Consul, the world's most used citizen platform. The "[Demokratiska St√§der](http://demokratiskastader.se)" website is a collection of methods and tools for Swedish cities that want to take their citizen participation to the next level.

## Social movements
We provide workshops and lectures for social movements about new tools for organising, decision making and coordination of campaigns.

## Hackathons
In [CivicTechSweden](http://civictech.se/en/) developers, designers, activists and open data enthusiasts come together to build applications, visualisations and tools for citizens.
